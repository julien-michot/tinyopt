Tinyopt, a lightweight header-only optimization library.

Is your optimization's convergence rate rivaling the speed of continental drift?
Tinyopt, the header-only C++ hero, swoops in to save the day! It's like a tiny,
caffeinated mathematician living in your project, ready to efficiently tackle those small-to-large optimization beasties,
including unconstrained and non-linear least squares puzzles.
Perfect for when your science or engineering project is about to implode from too much math.

In order to navigate the complex landscape of non-linear optimization, Tinyopt supports both dense and sparse systems
and contains a collection of iterative solvers including Gradient Descent,
Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms.

Furthermore, to facilitate the computation of derivatives, a crucial aspect of optimization,
Tinyopt seamlessly integrates the automatic differentiation capabilities.
This integration empowers users to effortlessly compute accurate gradients,
thereby streamlining the optimization process and enhancing the overall precision of the solutions obtained.

Here is an example on how to use Tinyopt:

  double x = 1;
  Optimize(x,  [](const auto &x) {return x * x - 2.0;}); // 'x' is âˆš2 after that, amazing.
