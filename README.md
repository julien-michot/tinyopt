# Tinyopt

Tired of wrestling with optimization problems that are just a little too big for a napkin sketch?
`Tinyopt`, the **header-only C++ hero**, swoops in to save the day! It's like a tiny,
caffeinated mathematician living in your project, ready to efficiently tackle those small-to-large optimization beasties,
including unconstrained and non-linear least squares puzzles.
Perfect for when your science or engineering project is about to implode from too much math.

Tinyopt provides **high-accuracy** and **computationally efficient** optimization capabilities, supporting both dense and sparse problem structures.
The library integratess a collection of iterative solvers including Gradient Descent, Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms (more are coming).

Furthermore, to facilitate the computation of derivatives, `Tinyopt` seamlessly integrates the **automatic differentiation** capabilities which empowers users to effortlessly compute accurate gradients.

# Usage

## Tinyopt: The "Just Works" Example (Minimal Edition)

Feeling lost? Fear not! We've crafted a delightful, teeny-tiny CMake project in [tinyopt-example](https://github.com/julien-michot/tinyopt-example) that'll have you parsing options faster than you can say "command-line arguments." It's so simple, even your pet rock could probably figure it out. (Though, we haven't tested that rigorously.)

## Tinyopt: the easy way

`Tinyopt` is inspired by the simple syntax of python so it is very developer friendly*, just call `Optimize` and give it something to optimize, say `x` and something to minimize.

`Optimize` performs automatic differentiation so you just have to specify the residual(s),
no jacodians/derivatives to calculate because you know the pain, right? No pain, vanished, thank you Julien.

\* but not compiler friendly, sorry gcc/clang but you'll have to work double because it's all templated.

### Example: What's the square root of 2?
Beause using `std::sqrt` is over hyped, let's try to recover it using `Tinyopt`, here is how to do:

```cpp
// Define 'x', the parameter to optimize, initialized to '1' (yeah, who doesn't like 1?)
double x = 1;
Optimize(x,  [](const auto &x) {return x * x - 2.0;}); // Let's minimize ε = x*x - 2
// 'x' is now √2, amazing.
```
That's it. Is it too verbose? Well remove the comments then. Come on, it's just two lines, I can't do better.


### API Documentation

Have a look at our [API doc](https://github.com/julien-michot/tinyopt/blob/main/docs/API.md) or delve into
the full doc at [ReadTheDocs](https://tinyopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

### Testing

`Tinyopt` comes with various tests, at least soon enough. Simply run `make test` to run them all.
Running the sqrt2 test should give you the following log:

```shell
tinyopt# make run_tinyopt_test_sqrt2
✅ #0: τ:0.00ms x:{1} |δx|:5.00e-01 λ:1.00e-04 ε:1.00e+00 n:1 dε:-3.403e+38 |∇|:4.000e+00
✅ #1: τ:0.06ms x:{1.49995} |δx|:8.33e-02 λ:3.33e-05 ε:2.50e-01 n:1 dε:-7.502e-01 |∇|:5.618e-01
✅ #2: τ:0.07ms x:{1.41667} |δx|:2.45e-03 λ:1.11e-05 ε:6.94e-03 n:1 dε:-2.429e-01 |∇|:3.871e-04
✅ #3: τ:0.08ms x:{1.41422} |δx|:2.11e-06 λ:3.70e-06 ε:5.96e-06 n:1 dε:-6.938e-03 |∇|:2.842e-10
✅ #4: τ:0.08ms x:{1.41421} |δx|:4.21e-08 λ:1.23e-06 ε:1.19e-07 n:1 dε:-5.841e-06 |∇|:1.137e-13
🌞 Reached minimal gradient (success)
```

## Benchmarks: How fast is Tinyopt?

`Tinyopt` is fast, **really fast**, one of the fastest optimization library out there!


## Setup
We're currently evaluating small dense problems (<33 dimensions) with one cost function on a
Ubuntu GNU/Linux 2024 64b.
We're showing without Automatic Differentiation as there's some time increase with it.
The script `benchmarks/scripts/run.sh` was called after making sure the CPU powermodes were all in 'performance'.
Plotting is done using the notebook `benchmarks/scripts/results.ipynb`.

## Results

Check this out, we're comparing `Tinyopt` against the well known [Ceres solver](http://ceres-solver.org/).

It's Super Green, Korben!

### Plot

![Benchmarks Plot](docs/benchmark-ceres-plot.png)

Dang, this thing's got some serious pep in its step, making other optimization libraries look like they're enjoying a leisurely Sunday drive. We put it in the ring with the well-respected Ceres solver, and the results were... eye-opening! My beloved old Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz computer (a true classic, if a bit slow by modern standards) practically sputtered trying to process Tinyopt's sheer velocity. I'm still double-checking the numbers to make sure my vintage machine wasn't just having a particularly enthusiastic day. Is it actually that quick? Well, Tinyopt's certainly making me wonder if my computer needs a pit stop for some performance upgrades!"

Note that the current benchmarks are only for somewhat *small* problems, I expect the timings difference will reduce
as the problem size (not residuals!) increases as Ceres-Solver has nice tricks that Tinyopt hasn't...just yet!

# Roadmap

Here is what is coming up. Don't trust too much the versions as I go with the flow.

### v1 (stable API + Armadillo)

- [ ] Refactor Numerical/Automatic differentiation to support NLLS and general optimizations
- [ ] Add l-BFGS for large sparse problems
- [ ] Native support of Armadillo (as alternative to Eigen)
- [ ] Update all docs

### v1.x (Bindings)
- [ ] Add C API
- [ ] Add python binding
- [ ] Add Rust binding

### v2 (refactoring, speed-ups & many solvers)
- [ ] Speed-up compilation (e.g. c++20 Concepts)
- [ ] Refactor Solvers
- [ ] Add various more solvers (CG, Adam, ...) and backend (e.g. Cuda)
- [ ] Speed-up large problems (e.g. AMD)

Ah ah, you thought I would use Jira for this list? No way.

## Fancy Lending a Hand? (We'd Love That!)
Feel free to contribute to the project, there's plenty of things to add,
from bindings to various languages to adding more solvers, examples and code optimizations
in order to make `Tinyopt`, truely the fastest optimization library!

Otherwise, have fun using `Tinyopt` ;)

## Got Big Ideas (or Just Want to Chat Business)?

If your business needs a super fast **Bundle Adjustment** (BA), a multisensor **SLAM** or
if `Tinyopt` is still taking its sweet time with your application and
you're finding yourself drumming your fingers impatiently, don't despair!
